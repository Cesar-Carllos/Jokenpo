## Description

<p>
  A simple game of rock, paper, scissors in JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
</p>

<p>
  Some of the main JavaScript tools and features used include:  
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>DOM Manipulation (Document Object Model): </b><br>
      The code extensively utilizes the DOM to interact with HTML elements, displaying messages, updating scores, and highlighting player and computer choices on the interface.
  </li><br>
  <li>
    <b> Functions: </b><br>
      Functions are used to modularize the code and perform specific operations, such as displaying messages, calculating the game winner, and updating scores.
  </li><br>
  <li> 
    <b> Event Listeners: </b><br>
      Event listeners are employed to detect user interactions, such as clicks on game options, and trigger corresponding functions in response to these events.
  </li><br>
  <li>
    <b>Logical and Comparison Operators: </b><br>
      The code utilizes logical operators (such as && and ||) and comparison operators (such as ===) to check the player's and computer's choices and determine the game's outcome.
  </li><br>
  <li>  
    <b>Math.random():</b><br>
      The Math.random() function is used to generate random numbers, allowing the computer to make a random choice between rock, paper, and scissors.
  </li><br>
  <li>
    <b>setTimeout():</b><br>
      The setTimeout() function is utilized to delay the removal of visual selections of player and computer choices, providing time for the user to see the round's outcome before the interface updates.
  </li><br>
  <p>
    These tools and features are essential for creating an interactive application in JavaScript, enabling manipulation of page elements, response to user events, and implementation of game logic.
  </p>
</ul>
